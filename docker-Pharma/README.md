"dump.sql" creates a table 'employees' in the mydb database. 

"config.php" connects the php code with the 'employees' table of mydb database.

"index.php" creates the frontend grid which displays records from "employees" table.

"create.php" generates web form that is used to insert records in the employees table.

"read.php" retrieves the records from the employees table.

"update.php" updates records in employees table.

"delete.php" deletes records in employees table.

"error.php" will be displyed if a request is invalid.
